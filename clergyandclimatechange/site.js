That man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.<br> One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD. The LORD said to Satan, &quot;Where have you come from?&quot; Satan answered the LORD, &quot;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.&quot; The LORD said to Satan, &quot;Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil. He still persists in his integrity, although you incited me against him, to destroy him for no reason.&quot; Then Satan answered the LORD, &quot;Skin for skin! All that people have they will give to save their lives. But stretch out your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.&quot; The LORD said to Satan, &quot;Very well, he is in your power; only spare his life.&quot;<br> So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and inflicted loathsome sores on Job from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. Job took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and sat among the ashes.<br> Then his wife said to him, &quot;Do you still persist in your integrity? Curse God, and die.&quot; But he said to her, &quot;You speak as any foolish woman would speak.

The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his partner. So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.

He is the reflection of God's glory and the exact imprint of God's very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.<br> Now God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels. But someone has testified somewhere,<br> &quot;What are human beings that you are mindful of them,<br> or mortals, that you care for them?<br> You have made them for a little while lower than the angels;<br> you have crowned them with glory and honor,<br> subjecting all things under their feet.&quot;<br> Now in subjecting all things to them, God left nothing outside their control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to them, but we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.<br> It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings. For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father.

But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.' 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.&quot;<br> Then in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. He said to them, &quot;Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.&quot;<br> People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them; and the disciples spoke sternly to them. But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, &quot;Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.&quot; And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.</p>"}

He shall drink neither wine nor intoxicants,[e] and no razor shall touch his head.&rdquo;<br> 12 As she continued praying before the Lord, Eli observed her mouth. 13 Hannah was praying silently; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was drunk. 14 So Eli said to her, &ldquo;How long will you make a drunken spectacle of yourself? Put away your wine.&rdquo; 15 But Hannah answered, &ldquo;No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord. 16 Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation all this time.&rdquo; 17 Then Eli answered, &ldquo;Go in peace; the God of Israel grant the petition you have made to him.&rdquo; 18 And she said, &ldquo;Let your servant find favor in your sight.&rdquo; Then the woman went to her quarters,[f] ate and drank with her husband,[g] and her countenance was sad no longer.[h]<br> 19 They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the Lord; then they went back to their house at Ramah.
